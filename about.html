        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my creative corner of the internet, where AI-music, human music, AI and human art, and video production intersect to bring the world of R.O.D. (Remnants of Destruction) to life. Inspired by the incredible legacy of my late friend, Sean Trusty, R.O.D. is more than just a passion project—it's a world rich with lore, characters, and stories that I am committed to developing into a fully immersive video game.</p>
        <p>As the creative force behind bringing this endeavor out of table-top and one day into a playable game, I combine my talents with words, AI and human music composition, AI-driven artwork, and cinematic storytelling to expand and explore the universe Sean began. Alongside several collaborators, I am crafting a narrative experience that honors Sean's vision while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in interactive storytelling.</p>
		
		<h2>Trusty's Foreword:</h2>
		<p>As a child and a young adult I enjoyed
		role-playing very much. My friends and I
		would get together on a Saturday afternoon
		and play for hours. We would play
		Dungeons&Dragons primarily with a
		smattering of other games sprinkled in from
		time-to-time to break up the monotony.</p>

		<p>It was always fun, but in my mind at
		least all the games available seemed to focus
		more on stringent rules and mathematical
		formulas than on the story being presented,
		and the fun we were supposed to be having.
		I've always felt role-playing should be an
		escape from your problems for a few hours,
		and not a math problem.</p>

		<p>In the winter of 1992 I was a soldier in
		the United States Army. I had met many other
		soldiers who had interest in role-playing
		games and shared my thoughts on the over
		use of rules for rules sake and the arguments
		that always ensued over each person's
		interpretation of the rules.
		I also took exception to people who
		would run stories where their character was a
		deity while yours was forever mediocre. I
		believe the player characters should always
		be the stars of the show and all NPCs should
		be there to add dimension to the world and
		flavor to the setting.
		Another thing I have never agreed
		with is the “Killer DM, or Killer Storyteller”
		These folks who do everything they can to
		harangue and kill the player characters as
		quickly and as often as possible. I found it
		hard to be invested in a story where my
		character would most likely be dead within
		three game sessions and I'd have to roll a new
		one. That was frustrating and made me lose
		interest. In my mind it's a poor storyteller
		who kills off all of his characters in the first
		chapter or for the sake of shock value, Mr.
		George R.R. Martin.</p>

		<p>So I decided to take matters into my own hands
		and if I couldn't find a system I could get behind, I'd
		simply have to make one.
		In the beginning the system was very free-form
		and had very few rules. This was alright, but soon
		proved to be as frustrating as having too many rules.
		Rolling dice for the sake of rolling dice gets old and
		changing the rules and game mechanics every game
		session got old fast.
		So I sat down one day and hashed out rules that
		make sense to me, and made the game work properly
		without bogging down the story. Every rule in this
		book is there to make the game flow and trust me it
		does, I've spent twenty two years making sure of it
		Even with that in mind, anyone playing this
		game, using this system or running a story is free to
		use any rules they choose and bend and break the ones
		that hinder your playing style. Role-playing is
		supposed to be fun, and if it isn't, why play?
		In the following pages you'll find everything
		you need to begin adventuring in the Savage Wastes. I
		hope you enjoy the game and the system and will use it
		for many years to come. It is as what I like to call roleplaying for grown-ups. It can be as dirty, gritty and
		violent as you like, or tone it down and make it more
		family friendly, the choice is yours. At any rate, have
		fun, and enjoy the fruits of my labor.</p>
		<p>-Sean V. Trusty.</p>

        <p>As Lord Tsarcasm, my goal is to create a seamless blend of human creativity and AI-assisted artistry, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development and interactive storytelling. The R.O.D. project is not just a game; it's a living, breathing world that continues to evolve with each piece of music, each poem, and each visual creation.</p>
        <p>I invite you to join me on this journey, to explore the dark and fantastical realm of R.O.D., and to be a part of bringing Sean's vision to life. Whether you're a fellow artist, a gamer, or simply someone who appreciates the fusion of technology and creativity, there's a place for you in this ever-expanding universe.</p>
