                <p>Welcome to my creative corner of the internet, where AI-music, human music, AI and human art, and video production intersect to bring the world of R.O.D. (Remnants of Destruction) to life. Inspired by the incredible legacy of my late friend, Sean Trusty, R.O.D. is more than just a passion project—it's a world rich with lore, characters, and stories that I am committed to developing into a fully immersive video game.</p>
                <p>As the creative force behind bringing this endeavor out of table-top and one day into a playable game, I combine my talents with words, AI and human music composition, AI-driven artwork, and cinematic storytelling to expand and explore the universe Sean began. Alongside several collaborators, I am crafting a narrative experience that honors Sean's vision while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in interactive storytelling.</p>

                <h2 id="foreword">Trusty's Foreword:</h2>
                <p>As a child and a young adult I enjoyed
                role-playing very much. My friends and I
                would get together on a Saturday afternoon
                and play for hours. We would play
                Dungeons & Dragons primarily with a
                smattering of other games sprinkled in from
                time-to-time to break up the monotony.</p>

                <p>It was always fun, but in my mind at
                least all the games available seemed to focus
                more on stringent rules and mathematical
                formulas than on the story being presented,
                and the fun we were supposed to be having.
                I've always felt role-playing should be an
                escape from your problems for a few hours,
                and not a math problem.</p>

                <p>In the winter of 1992 I was a soldier in
                the United States Army. I had met many other
                soldiers who had interest in role-playing
                games and shared my thoughts on the over
                use of rules for rules sake and the arguments
                that always ensued over each person's
                interpretation of the rules.
                I also took exception to people who
                would run stories where their character was a
                deity while yours was forever mediocre. I
                believe the player characters should always
                be the stars of the show and all NPCs should
                be there to add dimension to the world and
                flavor to the setting.
                Another thing I have never agreed
                with is the “Killer DM, or Killer Storyteller”
                These folks who do everything they can to
                harangue and kill the player characters as
                quickly and as often as possible. I found it
                hard to be invested in a story where my
                character would most likely be dead within
                three game sessions and I'd have to roll a new
                one. That was frustrating and made me lose
                interest. In my mind it's a poor storyteller
                who kills off all of his characters in the first
                chapter or for the sake of shock value, Mr.
                George R.R. Martin.</p>

                <p>So I decided to take matters into my own hands
                and if I couldn't find a system I could get behind, I'd
                simply have to make one.
                In the beginning the system was very free-form
                and had very few rules. This was alright, but soon
                proved to be as frustrating as having too many rules.
                Rolling dice for the sake of rolling dice gets old and
                changing the rules and game mechanics every game
                session got old fast.
                So I sat down one day and hashed out rules that
                make sense to me, and made the game work properly
                without bogging down the story. Every rule in this
                book is there to make the game flow and trust me it
                does, I've spent twenty two years making sure of it
                Even with that in mind, anyone playing this
                game, using this system or running a story is free to
                use any rules they choose and bend and break the ones
                that hinder your playing style. Role-playing is
                supposed to be fun, and if it isn't, why play?
                In the following pages you'll find everything
                you need to begin adventuring in the Savage Wastes. I
                hope you enjoy the game and the system and will use it
                for many years to come. It is as what I like to call roleplaying for grown-ups. It can be as dirty, gritty and
                violent as you like, or tone it down and make it more
                family friendly, the choice is yours. At any rate, have
                fun, and enjoy the fruits of my labor.</p>

                <p>As Lord Tsarcasm, my goal is to create a seamless blend of human creativity and AI-assisted artistry, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development and interactive storytelling. The R.O.D. project is not just a game; it's a living, breathing world that continues to evolve with each piece of music, each poem, and each visual creation.</p>
                <p>I invite you to join me on this journey, to explore the dark and fantastical realm of R.O.D., and to be a part of bringing Sean's vision to life. Whether you're a fellow artist, a gamer, or simply someone who appreciates the fusion of technology and creativity, there's a place for you in this ever-expanding universe.</p>
