Early Life (1990 – 2012)
Childhood in Roswell
Xris Samuel Hawkins was born in Roswell, New Mexico, a town forever marked by the 1947 encounter with the Tal'Ehn species from the Alpha Centauri galaxy. His parents, Anita Hawkins and Darren Hawkins, were esteemed scientists specializing in psionics and extraterrestrial technology. Anita's close friend and colleague was Azmina Kunera, a brilliant physicist and metallurgist known for inventing Hypersteel, a revolutionary material stronger than any known metal.

Family and Influences
Growing up in a household steeped in advanced science and philosophy, Xris was exposed to cutting-edge research and diverse cultures. Darren was an accomplished musician, and he nurtured Xris's love for music, teaching him to play the guitar from a young age. Anita, alongside Azmina, delved deep into the mysteries of psionics and alien technologies, often sharing their findings with Xris in simplified terms.

Early Signs of Psionic Abilities
Xris began exhibiting subtle psionic abilities during childhood. He could sense emotions, occasionally move objects without touching them, and his music seemed to have an uncanny effect on listeners. Recognizing these signs, his parents and Azmina guided him in controlling and concealing his abilities, emphasizing the importance of responsibility and discretion.

The Shal'Rah Invasion and Psionic Awakening (2012)
The Invasion Commences
In 2012, when Xris was 22, Earth was invaded by the Shal'Rah Collective, starting in Boulder, Colorado. The Shal'Rah, an empire led by the insectoid Shal'Rah Prime, sought to conquer and assimilate worlds. Their arrival brought chaos and devastation, and they introduced mutated creatures to instill fear and suppress resistance.

Roswell Under Threat
Roswell, due to its Tal'Ehn connections, became a strategic target. Anita, Darren, and Azmina worked tirelessly with the Tal'Ehn to develop defensive measures. They aimed to protect the town and its inhabitants from the impending assault, leveraging their combined expertise in psionics and advanced materials like Hypersteel.

The Ultimate Sacrifice
During a critical battle, a massive Shal'Rah attack threatened to annihilate Roswell. Anita and Darren activated a Tal'Ehn psionic amplification device to shield the area. The device required a life-force exchange, and they sacrificed themselves to save Xris and the community. Azmina, witnessing her friends' sacrifice, was devastated but continued the fight.

Unleashing Unparalleled Power
The loss of his parents unleashed a profound emotional surge in Xris, shattering the mental barriers that contained his psionic abilities. Channeling his grief through his guitar—a cherished gift from his father—he discovered he could manipulate reality with music. His melodies became powerful tools, capable of healing, shielding, and attacking.

Alliance with the Tal'Ehn and Early Resistance (2012 – 2026)
Forming the Resistance
Grieving yet determined, Xris joined forces with the Tal'Ehn and Azmina Kunera. Together, they formed a resistance cell aiming to thwart the Shal'Rah invasion. Azmina's knowledge of Hypersteel proved invaluable in creating weapons and armor capable of withstanding Shal'Rah technology.

Training and Mastery
Under the mentorship of Tal'Ehn psionic masters and guidance from Azmina, Xris honed his abilities. He mastered advanced psionics, learning to focus his powers through music. The Tal'Ehn philosophy of harmony and Azmina's scientific approach provided a balanced training regimen.

Covert Operations and Half-Breeds
During this time, the resistance discovered that the Shal'Rah were conducting experiments to create half-breed human/aliens, aiming to infiltrate and destabilize human society from within. The resistance worked to rescue these hybrids, many of whom joined their cause, adding unique abilities and perspectives to the group.

The H.I.V.E.'s Ambitious Counterattack (2026)
Rise of H.I.V.E.
The Human Intervention Victory Enclave (H.I.V.E.) emerged as a dominant faction, advocating for aggressive action against the Shal'Rah. Led by Peter Allan McVeigh, they believed that humanity's survival depended on asserting dominance.

Development of C.R.O.S.S.
H.I.V.E. scientists, with contributions from Azmina's research on Hypersteel (obtained without her consent), developed the Coalition for the Reclamation of the Sol System (C.R.O.S.S.). They built a fleet of advanced ships intended to take the fight to the Shal'Rah in space.

A Warning Ignored
Xris and Azmina warned H.I.V.E. leaders about the potential repercussions of such a direct assault, especially with untested technology. Their warnings were dismissed, and the fleet was launched.

The Disappearance
Shortly after launch, the entire C.R.O.S.S. fleet malfunctioned and vanished without a trace. It was as if they had been erased from existence. The Shal'Rah perceived this as an act of hostility.

Shal'Rah's Response
In retaliation, the Shal'Rah erected a planetary shield around Earth, trapping humanity and blocking all satellite communications. This isolation led to speculation that other continents had been destroyed or overrun, and mutated creatures began appearing worldwide.

Under the Planetary Siege (2026 – 2100)
Life Under the Shield
The planetary shield caused disruptions in climate and ecosystems. Communication was limited, resources became scarce, and society fragmented into isolated communities. The mutated creatures introduced by the Shal'Rah posed constant threats.

The Emergence of the DMZ
The constant warring between H.I.V.E. and the Federal Democratic Government (FDG) over territory and resources led to the creation of a devastated region between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This area became a no man's land, rife with destruction and danger.

Xris's Role
Xris became a wandering protector, traveling through the DMZ and beyond, aiding those in need. He defended settlements from mutated creatures and hostile factions, often arriving unexpectedly and leaving before gratitude could be expressed.

Collaboration with Azmina
Azmina continued her work, creating advanced equipment and aiding the resistance. She and Xris maintained close contact, sharing intelligence and coordinating efforts to mitigate the suffering caused by the Shal'Rah and the warring human factions.

Encounter with Kaanan Hellstrom (Circa 2110)
Introduction to the Slingers
The Slinger Project was a secret initiative aimed at creating super-soldiers by genetically combining human DNA with that of bats, bears, and dogs. Azmina Kunera was a key scientist in this project, responsible for inventing Hypersteel, used in their armor and weapons.

The Massacre in Kansas City
In Kansas City, a catastrophic event occurred where all Slingers were presumed killed by one of their own—Kaanan Hellstrom. The reasons remained shrouded in mystery, with rumors suggesting betrayal, malfunction, or external manipulation.

Meeting Kaanan
Xris encountered Kaanan in the ruins of Kansas City. Standing eight feet tall, wearing a red bodysuit and a Hypersteel horned helmet, Kaanan was a formidable figure haunted by his past. He was the last of the Slingers, burdened with guilt and seeking redemption.

An Unlikely Alliance
Recognizing a kindred spirit, Xris befriended Kaanan. With Azmina's connection to both men—having been a friend to Xris's mother and the creator of Kaanan's armor—they formed a strong alliance. Their combined abilities made them a powerful force against the myriad threats facing humanity.

The Return of the C.R.O.S.S. Platoon (2117)
A Disturbing Reappearance
In 2117, the vanished C.R.O.S.S. fleet reappeared, but the soldiers had been transformed into The Cross—black and green cultist monstrosities corrupted by unknown forces. They possessed terrifying abilities, such as draining life energy with a mere thought.

Waging War
The Cross launched attacks against the Shal'Rah and humanity alike. Their motives were unclear, but their actions sowed chaos. They also conducted experiments, creating new mutated creatures that terrorized the DMZ and beyond.

Confrontations with The Cross
Xris, Kaanan, and Azmina worked together to combat The Cross. Their encounters were perilous, with The Cross's powers challenging even Xris's advanced psionics. The trio sought to uncover the origins and weaknesses of these corrupted beings.

The Shal'Rah's Departure (2120)
An Unexpected Exit
Under relentless attacks from The Cross and facing resistance from humanity, the Shal'Rah decided to withdraw from Earth in 2120. Before leaving, they vowed to return and eradicate The Cross and any who opposed them.

Aftermath
The planetary shield remained, maintaining Earth's isolation. The departure of the Shal'Rah left a power vacuum, intensifying conflicts between human factions and leaving mutated creatures roaming unchecked.

A Fragile Truce
Shaken by the devastation, FDG and H.I.V.E. leaders agreed to a truce. They recognized the need to address greater threats, such as The Cross and the possibility of the Shal'Rah's return.

Battle Against Terrifying Mutations and Kaanan's Sacrifice (August 2124)
Emergence of New Mutations
In August 2124, reports surfaced of terrifying new mutations resulting from The Cross's experiments. These creatures were more powerful and aggressive, threatening to overrun settlements.

The Final Stand
Xris, Kaanan, and Azmina led a coalition of FDG and H.I.V.E. forces to confront the mutations near the DMZ. The battle was fierce, with heavy casualties on all sides.

Kaanan's Heroic Sacrifice
During the climax of the battle, a colossal mutation threatened to destroy a critical population center. Kaanan engaged the creature, using every ounce of his strength and the capabilities of his Hypersteel armor. Realizing that he couldn't defeat it conventionally, he activated a self-destruct mechanism in his armor's power core.

"For humanity," were his last words as the ensuing explosion annihilated the mutation and himself. His sacrifice saved countless lives and became a symbol of unity and courage.

Aftermath
Kaanan's death deeply affected Xris and Azmina. They vowed to continue fighting for the ideals he embodied. Memorials were erected, and stories of his bravery spread, inspiring others.
